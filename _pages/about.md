Hi! I am a third-year student at the University of Washington pursuing a Bachelors of Science in [Aerospace & Aeronautical Engineering](https://aa.washington.edu) and a Bachelors of Arts in [Mathematics](https://math.washington.edu). My interests lie in the field of aerospace controls research, particularly within control theory and optimization. My current projects involve leading the Payload & Avionics team of a compsite rocket project for the [Students for the Exploration and Development of Space](https://sites.uw.edu/seds/) and reaction wheel optimization for the [Husky Satellite Lab](https://huskysat.org). Past projects have involved a mass model and a wire harness for the [A&A Cubesat Team](https://aact.space).

I am a firm believer in the [axioms](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf) set out by Federico Ardila-Mantilla, which I additionally apply to engineering to the best of my ability. The best way to progress further in the field of engineering, both for the sake of progress and for customers, is to promote [diversity, equity, and inclusion](https://www.nspe.org/resources/pe-magazine/july-2020/why-should-i-care-about-diversity-engineering) within [engineering](https://www.colorado.edu/emp/2021/01/22/equity-inclusion-and-diversity-engineering-why-they-matter).
